# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects." 
These objects can represent real-world entities and are used to model and manage complex systems. 
OOP promotes greater flexibility and reusability in code, making it easier to develop and maintain applications.

## Four Main Concepts of OOP

### Encapsulation

- **Definition**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. 
It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse.
- **Example**: Think of a `Person` class that has attributes like `name`, `age`, and `address`. You can create methods such as `updateAddress()` that allow you to change the address safely. 
The internal representation of `address` can remain hidden from outside code, ensuring that only the method can modify it.

### Abstraction

- **Definition**: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. 
It helps in reducing programming complexity and increasing efficiency.
- **Example**: If you have a `Car` class, you may have methods like `startEngine()` and `stopEngine()`. Users of the `Car` class don't need to know how the engine works; 
they just need to know that calling `startEngine()` will start the car.

### Inheritance

- **Definition**: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (superclass). 
This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.
- **Example**: If you have a base class called `Employee`, you can create subclasses like `Manager` and `Intern`. Both subclasses inherit common properties like `name` and `salary` from `Employee` but can also have their unique methods or attributes, like `manageTeam()` for `Manager`.

### Polymorphism

- **Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It enables one interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types). 
The most common use of polymorphism is through method overriding and method overloading.
- **Example**: Continuing with the `Employee` class, you might have a method called `calculatePay()`. The `Manager` class could override this method to include bonuses, while the `Intern` class might calculate pay based on hours worked. Both classes can use the same method name, but the implementation differs based on the object calling it.

## Summary

OOP allows programmers to create modular, maintainable, and reusable code by leveraging concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
These principles can be applied in many programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C++, to model real-world scenarios effectively.
